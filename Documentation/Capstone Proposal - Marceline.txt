PROBLEM SOLVED

	�I think shorts are great! They're comfortable and easy to wear!� This project is a short homage to Youngster Joey, a bit of a cult favorite in Pokemon. I thought to myself, �I wonder what type of content someone who thinks like that would engage with?� And clearly the answer was that Youngster Joey would love a forum dedicated to appreciating shorts.

When the user clicks create post
Then they should be then taken to the create post page to choose an existing topic in a dropdown and enter in the body, and after clicking the post button should be taken to the post's new page 
Given the user wants to delete a post
When the user clicks the delete post button
Then they should be offered and �Are you sure?� Prompt, which should then permanently delete the post. Going to its link directly should then show �This post has been deleted�, but then still load comments from the post. 

As a User, I should be able to edit a post 
Given the user wants to edit a post
When the user clicks clicks the edit button on the post's page
Then that should open the edit post component, prefilled with the post's current information. After making their changes, they should be able to click complete edit to update the post, showing the updated content on the page
As a User, I should be able to edit my profile 
Given the user edit their profile
When the user My Profile from the navbar, then clicks the edit profile button (which will only load for the signed in account)
Then they should open drop downs and fields for their account information.

As a User, I should be able to view and filter posts  
Given the user wants to find and view specific types of posts
When the user is on the home page or clicks it from the navbar

STRETCH GOALS: STORIES & CRITERIA
As a user, I should be able to load and play their NPC trainer simulator
Given the user wants to experience life from the perspective of the NPCs
When the user selects �Pokemon NPC simulator�
Then  the site should load  a tiny pokemon simulator. This simulator should allow the user to setup and edit their trainer profile, provide an infinite loop of �normal� battles, and then a final battle with the main character of the game instantly defeats the player. Extra extra stretch goals : Character customization. Sprites/�animating� static images. Audio. Adding the possibility of �Winning� against the main character and having the main character �avoid� the player. Other running wild ideas that will probably be far too much work.
